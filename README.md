Folder mark.

A simple tool for quickly navigating between distant locations in a large and unfamiliar directory tree (source base).

Once you've located a "location of interest", you can quickly type:

fmark <name> to instantiate a mark at this location with the given name.
fjump <name> will immediately cd you back to that location.
funmark <name> will delete the location from your shortcuts.

Persistant storage is used in ~/.folder-mark

The utilities are defined as bash functions, so installation involves sourcing the foldermark.sh file into your environment.
