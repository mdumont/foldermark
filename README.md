Folder mark is intended to be a simple tool for quickly navigating between
distant locations in a large and unfamiliar directory tree (source base).

Once you've located a "location of interest", you can quickly type:

mark <name> to instantiate a mark at this location with the given name.
jump <name> will immediately cd you back to that location.

unmark <name> will delete the location from your shortcuts.

Persistant storage is used in ~/.foldermark
